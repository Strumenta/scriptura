  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    This report describes the design and evaluation of a <strong>film recommendation system</strong> that helps users
    discover movies they are likely to enjoy. Recommenders are widely used in streaming platforms, dramatically
    increasing engagement and watch time by surfacing relevant items within large catalogs.
  </p>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    Our goal is to build a modular, production-friendly pipeline that can rank films for each user based on historical
    interactions and content attributes. The system should support cold-start users/titles, scale to millions of events,
    and produce business-meaningful metrics.
  </p>

  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Offline model training and evaluation on a public dataset (e.g., MovieLens).</li>
    <li>Ranking for Top-K recommendations; optional rating prediction for comparison.</li>
    <li>Hybrid approach combining collaborative and content-based signals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Out of Scope</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>UI/UX for a consumer app and A/B testing in production.</li>
    <li>Hard real-time serving infrastructure (we simulate it offline).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    Collaborative filtering learns from userâ€“item interactions, while content-based methods use item metadata
    (genres, cast, keywords). Each has weaknesses (sparsity and cold start, respectively). A hybrid model can exploit
    their strengths: learn latent preferences and still recommend reasonable items for new users/titles.
